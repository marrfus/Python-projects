This view is said to be taken from “Olive Tree Island,” which might correspond to Ugljan.
The credits inform us that this plate was etched by Filhol and “completed” by Née. We’re assuming that Née worked with a burin, that is, using a hand-engraving technique as opposed to etching in which the metal is bitten into by acid. Mixing the two techniques was common practice at the time, although seldom explicitly stated. Sometimes etching would be used to merely outline the main figures, all the details and shading being engraved with the burin. At the other extreme, the burin would be used for just adding the finishing touches, such as deepening some of the grooves made in the etching process, thus finely adjusting the intensity of the shadows.

It shows Salomé in an exceedingly flared dress sitting at a dressing table in the Anglo-Japanese style as a bald coiffeur wearing a Pierrot costume and an eye mask attends to her unwieldy hairdo. Among the books to be found on the lower shelf of the table, one can see Nana by Émile Zola, works by the marquis de Sade, Manon Lescaut by abbé Prévost, and Apuleius’s Golden Ass, all titles certain to raise a few eyebrows at the time the play was first published."

The first version of this drawing didn’t include the fig leaf covering the androgynous page’s genitals, which was added on the demand of John Lane, the publisher. This latter, however, either missed or tolerated the phallic candlesticks and the spectacular erection unsuccessfully concealed beneath the clothes of the princess’s bizarre attendant. Beardsley didn’t appreciate Lane’s way of impinging on his work: to his friend Alfred Lambart, he gave a proof of this illustration printed before the addition of the fig leaf (and kept at the Princeton University Library), on which he wrote the following epigram:
Because one figure was undressed
This little drawing was suppressed
It was unkind —
But never mind
Perhaps it all was for the best —

In the years 1866, 1867 and 1868, there were also extraordinary meteoric displays on the night of November 13th. It was on the last mentioned date that I had the opportunity to observe the remarkable shower of shooting-stars of which I have attempted to represent all the characteristic points in plate XII. My observations were begun a little after midnight, and continued without interruption till sunrise. Over three thousand meteors were observed during this interval of time in the part of the sky visible from a northern window of my house. The maximum fall occurred between four and five o’clock, when they appeared at a mean rate of 15 in a minute.
In general, the falling stars were quite large, many being superior to Jupiter in brightness and apparent size, while a few even surpassed Venus, and were so brilliant that opaque objects cast a strong shadow during their flight. A great many left behind them a luminous train, which remained visible for more or less time after the nucleus had vanished."

The aim of the publishers and editors of the “Yellow Book” is to depart as far as may be from the bad old traditions of periodical literature, and to provide an Illustrated magazine which shall be as beautiful as a piece of bookmaking, modern and distinguished in its letterpress and its pictures, and withal popular in the better sense of the word. It is felt that such a magazine, at present, is conspicuous by its absence.
In point of technical excellence the “Yellow Book” will be as nearly perfect as it can be made. The present announcement shows the size and shape of the paper  (now being especially woven) on which it will be printed, as well as the type that will be used, and the proportion of text and margin.

A total eclipse of the sun is a most beautiful and imposing phenomenon. At the predicted time the perfectly round disk of the sun becomes slightly indented at its western limb by the yet invisible moon. This phenomenon is known as the “first contact.”
The slight indentation observed gradually increases with the advance of the Moon from west to east, the irregularities of the surface of our satellite being plainly visible on the border of the dark segment advancing on the sun’s disk. With the advance of the Moon on the sun, the light gradually diminishes on the earth.

It is one of the most distinct plains of the moon, and is easily seen with the naked eye on the left-hand side of the disk.

On July 2d, 1881, at 9 o’clock, the nucleus of comet 1881, III., which is represented on plate XI., appeared sharply defined, bright and considerably flattened crosswise; but half an hour later it had considerably enlarged and had become so diffused that it could hardly be distinguished from the coma, with which it gradually blended. It is perhaps worth mention that, at the time this last observation was made, an aurora borealis was visible. This comet 1881, III., underwent other very important changes of its nucleus, coma and tail.

It is described as follows by George Henry Wathen[1]:
Majestic in ruin, what must it have been when perfect? The massive stone roof is supported by a phalanx of one hundred and thirty-four giant columns, ranged in sixteen rows; most of these are nine feet in diameter, and nearly forty-three feet high; but those of the central avenue are not less than eleven feet six inches in diameter, and seventy-two feet high. The diameter of their capitals at their widest spread is twenty-two feet. The walls, columns, architraves, ceilings—every surface exposed to the eye is overspread with intaglio sculptures—gods, heroes, and hieroglyphics, painted in once vivid colours. It is easy to detail the dimensions of this building, but no description can convey an idea of its sublime effect. What massive grandeur in its vistas of enormous columns! what scenic effects in the gradations of the chiaro-scuro, and the gleamings of accidental lights athwart the aisles!"

The kiosk was moved to Agilkia Island in the 1960s to be preserved from the effects of the Aswan Dam. It is described as follows by the authors:
This is one of the most beautiful objects on the island of Philae, and seems to have been built for its striking and picturesque effect. It is placed on the eastern side of the island, and, in our view, appears as it is seen by the traveller who ascends the Nile. This little temple is only sixty feet long and forty-five feet wide: the style of its proportion is elongated, as if the architect had thus intended to increase its effect as seen from the river. It has five columns on each side, and four at each end, between the centre columns at each of these is an entrance; all else around is inclosed by walls, which reach to two-thirds of the height of the columns. The architrave is raised high above the columns, being placed on upright stones, which rest upon the lotus-headed capitals; the open spaces between are out of all architectural rule or proportion, but in spite of this, it is strikingly elegant. The entrances are open to the Great Temple on the west, and to the Nile on the east; outside the river-gate is a platform, or terrace, which forms also a quay that extends nearly round the island; the principal landing-place for travellers is below this temple, and here their boats are usually moored."

The temple and its rediscovery in 1817 are described as follows by the authors:
Belzoni and his friends removed forty feet of sand, which had accumulated above the top of the door before the recent excavations; but they carried them no further than three feet below the top of the entrance, when they effected their passage into this temple and saw the most extraordinary work that remains to us of the age of Remeses [sic] II. Belzoni describes its facade as one hundred and seventeen feet wide and eighty-six feet high… Each of these enormous statues… measures from the shoulder to the elbow fifteen feet six inches… Their height as they sit is about fifty-one feet not including the caps, which are about fourteen feet. These, the most beautiful colossi yet found in any of the Egyptian ruins, represent Remeses II. They are seated on thrones attached to the rock. On the sides, and on the front angles of the thrones, and between the legs of the statues, are sculptured female figures, supposed to be of his wife and children; they are well preserved, though the material is a coarse friable gritstone. During the execution, defects in the stone were filled and smoothed with stucco, and afterwards painted, of which traces yet remain."

Built during the Ptolemaic dynasty, Kom Ombo Temple is located 25 miles (40 km) north of Aswan and was dedicated in equal parts to the crocodile god Sobek and to Horus the Elder. It is described as follows by the authors:
These ruins are finely situated on a promontory on the eastern side of the river, in a bay formed by the head of the Nile to the westward. In descending the river the temple thus seen on the high bank above it holds a striking position. There are remains of other temples below, on the verge of the Nile, but the stream which sweeps round the bend has already carried off, even within our own time, some of these interesting monuments, and will eventually remove them all by undermining the banks. Of the great temple, much is concealed by vast sand-drifts from the deserts; but enormous masses of its ruins rise above the arid and herbless surface which surrounds them, giving to the scene a character of dreary desolation in keeping with the decay of this once magnificent structure."

The bazaar is described as follows by the authors:
The actual situation of this bazaar is between the walls of these two mosques, which finish at the top with a trefoil sort of battlement whereon rafters rest, with props to support the wooden roof, that at a great height covers the Bazaar, admitting light enough, but sheltering it from the rays of the sun. Each Bazaar is generally appropriated to a particular class of merchandise, and this, the chief in Cairo, for the sale of rich silks, cottons, and embroidered stuffs, some wrought in gold-thread and other costly materials; and the articles to be bought here are the most splendid productions of this class. The Bazaars of Cairo, as in all Eastern cities, are confined to streets and passages, which are closed at night by wooden doors and a chain, and guarded by watchmen: they are, however, by day the gayest and most amusing parts of the city. Here the shopkeeper rests on a sort of dais, or shopboard, about three feet above the footway, his goods being kept in recesses behind him. He generally sits cross-legged and patient, awaiting the arrival of a customer; he uses little art to induce him to purchase; he sits in solemn silence, and will scarcely remove his pipe from his lips to answer the inquiries of the passers-by."

The illustration is complemented by the following quotation from William Wordsworth’s poem The tables Turned: We murder to dissect.
The type of the medical student is described in detail by P. Leigh, in the accompanying literary sketch:
A young gentleman, of about five feet eight inches in height, with dull darkish eyes, and eyebrows to match—interlacing over the root of the nose, the last-mentioned feature being large, long, and fleshy, and in excellent keeping with a couple of thick projecting lips. The complexion is a kind of smoky tallow; the forehead is narrow and sloping, but the contour of the rest of the head is concealed by a four-and-ninepenny gossamer, with a very narrow brim and sundry indentations in front, worn sideways in the most approved fashion of billiard-room frequenters, and visitors of night-houses. A black neckerchief, tied à la Ben Brace, a very high and not very clean shirt-collar, a rough flushing jacket garnished with broad black bone buttons, a very long waistcoat of a shawl pattern, and blue shaggy trousers splashed with mud at their terminations, complete the costume. The tout-ensemble forms an illustration of “December fashions for Gentlemen,” as modified in the person of a probationary guardian of the public health” in statu pupillari,”—that is, in the course of “walking the hospitals.”"

The authors describe it as follows:
This striking view is taken from a ruined mosque near the city walls, and looking towards the rock of the citadel, which stretches along the horizon, from where it intercepts the range of the distant Mocattam hills to the Great Mosque of the Sultan Hassan. Between the observer and the hill of the citadel lies the great necropolis of Cairo, that part of the eastern desert which extends from its walls to the Mocattam range, in which the dead of ages are laid, and where those splendid religious edifices are found which are commonly called the Tombs of the sultans. The ruined mosque in the foreground is built in an angle of the city wall. From one of the gates below a caravan is seen issuing, and masses of building which intervene between the ruined mosque and the Citadel are broken by the domes and minarets of the mosques of Cairo.
The citadel itself is covered with a range of buildings, that present in this view rather the appearance of a barracks than the palace and mosque of the Pasha, where he holds his court, though his domestic residence is in the isle of Shoubra. "

These carts ply all day, except during the heats of summer, when they work only in the morning and evening, and the whole city is supplied by their means; for the wells, though numerous, produce nothing but bad, brackish water, unfit for culinary purposes: the number of carts is consequently considerable. The cask is commonly a butt or puncheon, which is raised upon wheels eight feet high, to enable the carts to go deep into the water, that it may be procured as clean as possible. The bucket contains about four gallons, and four times this quantity drawn off and deposited by the driver in the yard of the house, where a cask is always kept for the purpose, costs half a rial. The piece of hide which hangs at the tail of the cart, is laid upon the ground to keep the bucket clean, while the latter is filling by means of the hose attached to the back-head of the butt."

On the north are some good private houses, and the cathedral, part of which is seen. The Cabildo, or town-hall, occupies the west side, having also a piazza.

The author describes these soldiers as follows:
The protracted war maintained by these soldiers against both the Portuguese and the troops of the Buenos Ayres Union, renders them objects of interest. They are, in fact, nothing more than gauchos in another dress, and scarcely more formidable for having added to the knife, lazo, and balls, the auxiliaries of carbine and sabre. These two last are generally carried under the seat across the saddle, as represented in the engraving.
Thus armed, living habitually in the open air, sleeping with their horses, requiring no food but beef, for which they drive the living animals before them, leaving a desert to their enemies, these soldiers carry on a desultory warfare, flying before their opponents, and renewing the attack when least expected. Incapable of acting together in numbers, they never present a head to their enemy, whom they nevertheless keep constantly on the alert, and tease and harass, be his force what it may. In short, they may not unaptly be denominated the Cossacks of America. …
These soldiers are represented at the door of a pulperia at Monte Video. One of them is taking matte."

The author describes such Buenos Aires milk boys in the following terms:
The city of Buenos Ayres is regularly supplied with milk from the surrounding estantias, or farms, from one to three miles distant. It is brought on horseback in earthen or tin bottles, four and sometimes six of which are carried by each horse in hide pockets, attached to the saddle, and laced up with a piece of thong.
The milk-boys may almost be said to be born on horseback, so early are they initiated into their occupation. Most of them are children under ten years of age, so small that they are obliged to climb up their horses by means of one long stirrup, which is used for no other purpose. They sit between the jars, and in that insecure position ride most furiously. When out of the city, they run races one against another; and after they have sold their milk, may often be seen in parties gambling, or chucking rials and quarter-dollars, as among us children do farthings."

On June 23, 1797, Friedrich Wilhelm Joachim dived into the River Oder wearing Klingert’s apparatus, reached the bottom, and was able to saw through a tree trunk.
According to the author, this diving suit was made of tinplate, complemented with a short-sleeve shirt and leather breeches. The eye holes (B) were fitted with glass, and weights hanging at the hips (E) allowed for the diver’s stability underwater. Fresh air came down one pipe and a second one returned the exhaust air, while two containers (D) collected the water which would inevitably find its way inside the pipes. This device could allow a diver to go as deep as 20 or 22 ft (6 or 7 m), and it seems that in the history of diving gear, it was to become little more than a stepping stone for further improvement.

The plaform (GH) where the diver was supposed to stand when working was kept steady with weights. The air could be renewed thanks to barrels of compressed air (E) sent from the surface.
The diver walking the seabed (X) illustrates the most experimental part of the device: intended to increase the mobility of the divers and broaden the range of their action, it consisted of a smaller bell made of sheet metal worn as a helmet, and though the author warns about how dangerous this would have been, he doesn’t make it clear it was ever actually used.

Hoping there’s none I do offend,
And thus my merry joke doth end

Vincent de Groof was a Belgian shoemaker who styled himself the “Flying Man.” On July 9, 1874, he had his ornithopter launched from a balloon in an attempt to fly across the London sky. He met his death in Robert street (now part of Sydney street).
This story was told at greater length in the Daily Telegraph and the Penny Magazine.
The caption reads in the original French: Chute de l’homme volant, à Londres.
It was announced yesterday that, at 7.30 p.m., M. de Groof, the “Flying Man” would repeat at the Cremorne Gardens “his astounding performance of flying through the air a distance of 5,000 feet.” True to this announcement, the Flying Man did endeavour to repeat the exploit which he had accomplished in safety ten days before, and perished in the attempt. M. de Groof was a Belgian, who had expended years in constructing for himself an apparatus with which he believed it possible to imitate the flight of a bird. The general outline of this apparatus was an  immitation of a bat’s wings, the framework being made of cane, and the intervening membrane of stout waterproof silk. The wings were in all 37 feet long, with an average breadth of 4 feet, while the tail was 18 feet by 3. These wings were inserted  into two hinged frames that were attached to a wooden stand upon which the aeronaut took his place. Here he had three levers which he worked by hand to give his machine propulsion or guidance as might be required; his theory being that having started from a given height, he could manage his descent so as to reach the earth by a sort of inclined swooping motion, without risk of concussion. About a year ago M. de Groof made an attempt, of which our correspondent at the time telegraphed the particulars. to descend from a great neight on the Grande Place at Brussels. The effort was a failure, but l’Homme Volant as he was then called, escaped unhurt, though his network was afterwards torn in pieces by the crowd. On Monday, the 20th ultimo, however, M. de Groof repeated his experiment at Cremorne Gardens, with success. Mr. Baum, tho proprietor of the gardens, had, it seems, after making an engagement with  him, felt some uneasiness as to the result, and at first refused to allow the trial to be made. The “Flying Man” protested the absolute feasibility of his scheme, and insisted on the contract being carried out; and this was done. The wings and stand were attached to a balloon guided by Mr. Simmons, who, after drifting over London towards Brandon, in Essex, released his companion at a considerable height—three or four hundred feet, it is said—and the flying apparatus was immediately set in motion. “For a time” it is stated, “it was a race between the aeronaut and the flyer, De Groof winning by two flelds’ lengths, and attaining the ground in perfect safety.”
How the accident occurred last night cannot be clearly ascertained. The apparatus, previous to the ascent, seemed in satisfactory order, and De Groof—though, according to custom, he took an affectionate farewell of his wife—appeared fully confident of making a successful ascent. About a quarter to 8 o’clock the balloon was cut loose, and rose slowly in the air, bearing with it the Flying Man and his gear. There was hardly a breath of air, a circumstance which might have been supposed to be favourable to the performance of an aeronautical feat of the kind. Be this as it may, however, when the balloon had attained a height of three or four hundred feet, the unfortunate performer seemed either to mistrust his own powers or the capability of his apparatus, for he was heard by the spectators below shouting to the man in the balloon to bring him nearer the earth. This request was complied with, and the balloon descended slowly towards Robert-street, which lies a quarter of a mile or so to the north of Cremorne Gardens. On approaching St. Luke’s Church, Mr. Simmons, the balloonist, was heard to say: “Yon must cut loose now, or you’ll come on the church roof.” The answer was, “Yes; let me drop into the churchyard,” and these were, no doubt, the last words De Groof uttered. He cut the rope when about eighty feet from the ground, but, to the horror of the spectators, who must have numbered many thousand, the apparatus, instead of inflating with the pressure of the air, collapsed, and, turning round and round in its descent, fell with great violence in Robert-street, a yard or two from the kerbstone. Assistance to the unfortunate man was instantly forthcoming. Although still breathing, he was insensible; but the despatch with which he was extricated from the wreck of his apparatus and conveyed to Chelsea Infirmary proved in vain. He never recovered consciousness, and on his arrival at the hospital the surgeons pronounced him dead, Madame oe Groof, who witnessed her husband’s fall, fainted at the sight, and a still more painful scene took place a short time later at the hospital, when she learned the whole sad truth. The apparatus was carried off in shreds by the crowd before the police could secure it. From the hospital the body was removed to the dead-house, where it now awaits the inquest. It only remains to add that the balloon, on being freed from the weight of De Groof and his flying machine, soared away over the metropolis in a north-easterly direction; and, at dark, was seen at a great height above Victoria Park, where it was watched with much interest by large numbers of people, who were, of course, ignorant of the shocking tragedy in which it had played a part.
From the Daily Teleqraph, July 10, 1874.

The most dramatic event involving St. Luke’s and the Burial Ground came in 1874. From its early days as a pleasure garden, entertainments at Cremorne Gardens (near to where Lots Road Generating Station now stands) had featured parachutists and balloonists. The need for increasingly spectacular displays brought the “flying man” M. Vincent de Groof, variously described in contemporary newspapers as a Frenchman and a Belgian, and his flying machine to Cremorne on June 29th.
The flying machine was in fact a glider of cane and waterproof silk, “flown” by operating the wings and tail from a caged platform slung in the centre. Initial ascent was achieved by attachment to a balloon, and de Groof intended to cast himself loose from the balloon at a suitable height and fly back down to the Gardens. On June 29th, however, the balloon—the “Czar”, flown by Mr. Simmons—was carried away to Brandon in Suffolk where de Groof was supposed to have made a successful descent. Another attempt was organised, with much publicity, for 9th July, andagain de Groof and his machine were hoisted from the Gardens by the “Czar”. After hovering over the Gardens the balloon was blown close to St. Luke’s Church, and the crowd was then treated to the awesome spectacle of de Groof and his machine plunging out of control to crash on to Robert Street, now the part of Sydney Street by the church. De Groof was rushed to Chelsea Infirmary where he died from his injuries.
The balloon, suddenly freed of the weight of man and machine, rose so sharply upwards that Simmons lost consciousness. When he came to, he was again being carried eastwards over London, this time towards Springfield in Essex. Simmons attempted to land but his grapnel dragged and he came down on the Great Eastern Railway line. A passing train stopped to avoid collision, and the engine crew helped Simmons in the last few feet of his descent.
Public opinion and the Press were much exercised over the affair, and the desirability of people risking their necks to experiment and to entertain. Simmons felt the need to write to the main papers, thanking the Great Eastern Railwaymen and denying any responsibility for de Groof’s fall: according to Simmons, there was never any communication between the two men except for bi-lingual confirmation of their altitude and the signal de Groof was supposed to give when he was about to sever contact with the balloon. At the public inquiry, Simmons said his first intimation of the turn of events was a sideways pull on the basket; when he looked over the side he saw de Groof and his machine commencing their fall, already hopelessly tilted and out of control. Later in the inquiry, estate workers at Brandon cast doubt on the successful flight on June 29th, and it is possible that the flying machine had never been properly tried at the time that de Groof met his death. The verdict was death by misadventure, no blame being attached to Simmons or the Gardens’ managers.
More skilled men than de Groof were later to die testing gliders in the development of manned flight, men like Otto Lilienthal and Percy Pilcher; there was, however, a prophetic footnote to the sensational affair in the Daily News, July 11th 1874:
“Flying Machines, properly devised and driven as they must be driven, if they are to fly at all, at enormous speed, may be among the most advantageous modes of conveyance of future times.”

From the few individuals which we have seen of this species at different periods, and from many more of the crosses between the Irish and English Greyhound, we are inclined to think that the specimen here offered to the public eye, is a true representation of the original Greyhound of Ireland, meaning thereby, nearly such, in point of form and qualification, as he was, many ages since, imported from some of the eastern countries bordering on the Mediterranean."

The grand or questing quality of the Spaniel, is well known, and his bustling and constant activity. The pleasure which his nature affords him, in the occupation of hunting out the game, he demonstrates by the perpetual motion, or feathering of his tail, which increases and becomes more tremulous and nervously affected, the nearer he approaches the object of his search.

No risk is incurred by pronouncing this dog the most useful of the whole canine race, as far as hitherto known, upon the face of the earth. His powers, both of body and of intellect, are unequaled, and he seems to have been created with an unconquerable disposition to make the most benevolent use of those powers. His services are voluntary, ardent, incessant, and his attachment and obedience to man, natural and without bounds. The benignity of his countenance is a true index of his disposition, and nature has been so partial to this paragon of dogs, that while he seems to be free from their usual enmities and quarrelsomeness, he is endowed with most heroic degree of courage, whether to resent an insult, or to defend, to his last gasp, his master or companion when in danger. His sagacity likewise, surpasses belief, as do the numerous and important services rendered to society, by this invaluable race, in lives saved, persons defended, and goods recovered, which by no other possible means could have been recovered."

La Pompe Notre-Dame is a very nearly accurate reproduction of that building, which, it is said, is soon to disappear. I have nevertheless allowed myself to make a few modifications, and changed the proportions of certain parts, in order to relieve the monument of some of its heaviness. The towers[1] also rise a little higher than in reality, but I consider that these licenses are allowed, as this is, so to speak, the way in which the mind works as soon as the object which made an impression upon it has disappeared from before the eyes…
(La Pompe Notre-Dame est à bien peu près la reproduction textuelle de cette bâtisse qui va, dit-on, bientôt disparaître. Je me suis cependant permis quelques petits changements, en modifiant les rapports de certaines parties, dans le but d’enlever au monument un peu de sa lourdeur. Les tours saillent aussi un peu plus que dans la réalité ; mais je considère que ce sont licences permises, puisque c’est pour ainsi dire dans ce sens que travaille l’esprit, sitôt que l’objet qui l’a frappé a disparu de devant les yeux…[2])

The singular collection of skeleton figures represented in the accompanying plate, occupies a recess of the temple on the right-hand side of the entrance, and forms a striking contrast to the joyous character of the groups in each of the other compartments or recesses.

The most ancient of these tombs is the mausoleum of the founder, Quli Qutb; which was built above 300 years ago—the remainder being erected at intervals during about 150 years subsequently, which gives the date of the last erection. The tombs of the kings are spread over a wide plain on the north side of the city, about 600 yards from the fort; and many of them still present very splendid specimens of the Saracenic style of architecture that has since spread over the civilised world, and effected so much for the ornamentation of the great cites of Europe."

The corresponding passage describes the site as follows:
The abbey at Mussoorie occupies a very commanding site, apart from all other habitations, on the extreme summit of a rugged mountain. During the fine weather, the prospects obtained from its elevated situation much more than compensate for any disadvantage; but, in the wet season, it is completely enveloped in mist, and damp clouds penetrate through every aperture. The intrusion of fog into a house is sufficiently disagreeable; but in these altitudes the clouds take the same liberty; and suddenly, if sitting in an apartment with the door or window open, the inhabitants often find themselves wrapped in a very poetical but very inconvenient garment. The storms, also, experienced in these elevated situations are exceedingly terrific; occasionally they rage below the residence, encircling some sublime peak of the Landour range; but at other limes they pour their unbroken fury on the devoted mansion and its terrified inhabitants—the thunder peals amidst the snow-storm, while lightning flashes around like a continuous sheet of fire, and a tremendous hurricane threatens destruction to whatever opposes its progress.

The river Ganges, in its progress through the plains, waters many spots of remarkable beauty; but in the whole course of its brilliant career, it can scarcely boast a more splendid landscape than that in which the rocks of Jahangira form a prominent feature. Standing boldly out in the stream, near a place called Sultanganj, in the province of Bihar (about ninety miles east of Patna), this picturesque pile forms a beautiful object. It consists of several masses of grey granite, heaped one upon the other in an irregular manner, forming ledges and terraces, which have become the sites of numerous small temples. In some places, a crevice in the side of the rock has afforded room for the roots of magnificent trees to shoot upwards, and crown the romantic height with bright foliage."

694,"Catherwood, Frederick",Gateway at Labnah [sic].,https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/gateway-labna/,"The remains of a Mayan building isolates a square, where small groups of men are scattered, from the forest behind. The building is described as follows by the author:
This may be considered as one of the most pleasing architectural designs to be met with among the ruined edifices of Yucatan. It is the inner façade of an arched gateway, ten feet wide, leading into what was formerly the courtyard of a large building. Under the arch are two doorways, giving entrance to two small rooms, twelve feet by eight (3.66 by 2.44 m), which also have openings towards the area. Over each doorway is a square recess, flanked by small pilasters, and supporting a mass of masonry pyramidally disposed. In the recesses are the remains of rich ornaments in stucco, with marks of colours still clearly visible, perhaps intended to represent the face of the sun surrounded by its rays, and probably to the Indian an object of superstitious adoration. The construction of the arch is the same as is found all over the country. The stones are laid horizontally, each projecting a little beyond the under one, until at last they nearly meet, and a flat cover-stone completes the arch, if it may be so called. This species of roof has its advantages; there is no lateral thrust, and frequently, vhen one side of an apartment, and, consequently, half the roof had fallen, the other remains entire. The cement used was very good, equal, in many instances, to that found in the ancient Roman buildings."

This portion of the building is described as follows by the author:
It forms part of an exceedingly rich and highly-decorated fafade, two hundred and sixty-four feet (80 m) long; and which, for profusion of ornament, rivals, if it does not surpass, the front of the Casa del Gobernador. […] There are, or rather were, five similar structures in the facade, and, although at a distance, they appear exactly alike—and are so, as regards general outline and size—yet the detail and making-up of the ornaments differ in each; and this observation will apply equally to the façades of nearly all the buildings at Uxmal, in which occur endless varieties in the detail of the decorations."
696,"Catherwood, Frederick","Teocallis, at Chichen-Itza.",https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/chichen-itza/,"El Castillo, also known as the Temple of Kukulcan, in the ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza, is seen from ground level rising between trees, the sides of the pyramid and the top of the temple overgrown with vegetation. It is described as follows by the author:
The plate represents the Castillo, or Castle, the first building seen on approaching the ruins, and, from every point of view, the grandest and most conspicuous object that towers above the plain. The mound measures at the base, on the north and south sides, one hundred and ninety-six feet ten inches (60 m); and on the east and west sides, two hundred and two feet (61.6 m). It does not face the cardinal points exactly, though probably so intended; and in all the buildings, from some cause not easily accounted for, while one varies ten degrees one way, that immediately adjoining varies twelve or thirteen degrees the other. It is built up, apparently solid, from the plain to the height of seventy-five feet (22.9 m). On the west side is a staircase, thirty-seven feet (11.3 m) wide; on the north, being that presented in the engraving, the staircase is forty-four feet (13.4 m) wide, and has ninety steps. On the ground at the foot of the staircase, forming a bold, striking, and well-conceived commencement to this lofty range, are two colossal serpent’s heads, ten feet (3 m) in length, with mouths wide open and tongues protruding, as shown by the fragment in the foreground of the drawing: no doubt they were emblematic of some religious belief."

The inner room is raised two feet eight inches (0.8 m) higher than the front, and the ascent is by two steps, carved out of a single block of stone, the lower one being in the form of a scroll. The sides of the steps are enriched with a similar ornament to that of the facade of the building. Extending from either side of this ornament to the ends of the apartment are small engaged columns, without either base or capital.

This idol, in its ruined state, is one of the most beautiful in Copan; and in workmanship, is equal to the best remains of Egyptian art. Its present condition may give some idea of the scene of desolation and ruin presented at Copan. The whole region is an overgrown forest; and, amidst the prostration and wreck of buildings and terraces, one “idol” is seen displaced from its pedestal hy monstrous roots,—another locked in the close embrace of branches of trees, and almost lifted out of the earth,—and another hurled to the ground, and bound down hy large vines and creepers; of this, the fallen part was thus completely bound to the earth, and, before it could be drawn, it was necessary to unlace them, and tear the fibres out of the crevices. This fallen statue is of about the same dimensions with the others. The paint is very perfect, and has preserved the stone which makes it more to be regretted that it is broken. The altar is buried, with the top barely visible, which, by excavating we made out to represent the back of a tortoise."
708,"Catherwood, Frederick",Idol at Copan.,https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/idol-copan/,"View of a Mayan stone idol standing against a background of woodland. This sculpture is described as follows by the author:
The idol is carved out of a single block of compact limestone, and measures eleven feet eight inches (3.56 m) in height, and three feet four inches (1.02 m) on each side, standing on a pedestal six feet (1.83 m) square. It is surrounded by a circular stone curb or rim, measuring, in its outer diameter, sixteen feet six inches (5.03 m). A sacrificial stone, or altar, stands in front of it, at a distance of eight feet ten inches, but is not introduced into the drawing, as it would have hidden the lower part of the figure. It is placed diagonally towards the idol, measuring seven feet across. There is every probability (from the deep groovings, or channels, on all the altars) that they were used for the immolation of human victims. The idol, viewed in front, represents a woman of middle age, with the arms curiously raised and bent before her; the wrists are adorned with bracelets of beads, and the neck profusely covered with necklaces; on either side of the head decends a tress of hair; the ears are large, unnatural in their shape, and are decorated with ear-drops; immediately over the forehead appears a row of beads attached to the hair. The head-dress is not easy to describe: it is very lofty, and one of its peculiarities is a skull, or upper part of the head of some animal, the lower jaw being wanting. Whether the remainder of the head-dress is intended to represent feathers, or flowers, or a mixture of the two, is doubtful. The lower part of the dress has the appearance of a cotton robe (cotton being indigenous to the country, and much used), ornamented with chequer work, and fringed with beads. The feet are clothed in sandals of precisely the same form as are found in some of the old Roman statues; they appear to have been a conspicuous part of the dress. The sides of the idol have rows of hieroglyphics, and the back is as elaborately carved as the front, but the subject is totally different. It presents a mask, surrounded by complicated ornaments, with a gracefully disposed border, and, at the base, rows of hieroglyphics."

This decoration is described as follows by the author:
The central ornament over the principal doorway was a seated figure, of which but slight traces remain. The headdress of feathers is more perfect, and appears totally disproportioned to the size of the figure. On either side are parallel bars of stone, between which are well sculptured hieroglyphics. The cornice was perhaps intended to represent the coilings of a serpent; it is continued from one extremity of the building to the other, and goes entirely round it."

It looked a lofty and colossal structure, rising in stories or terraces, one above another, against the sides of the mountain to its summit, and there crowned with towers. We ascended flights of steps, climbed up a ladder, crept through a small door only large enough to admit one at a time, and found ourselves in an antechamber, surrounded by above a hundred Greek pilgrims.”"

One scroll alone, of acanthus leaves, with groups of children and panthers intertwined, might form a work of itself. Even independently of the beauty of the sculpture, and its excellent preservation, we are lost in wonder at the size of the stones, and at the nature of the machinery by which such masses were raised. Earthquakes have shaken this extraordinary remnant; but from the magnitude of the blocks which form the lintel, the central one, being wedge-shaped, has slipped only so far as to break away a portion of the blocks on either side, and thus remain suspended."

with the countries on the Euphrates, and thence with Persia and India. The pass is singularly difficult, and still inherits its evil name as a place of robbers. In this scene of the Parable of the Good Samaritan, no stranger ventures without an escort, But its variety and boldness strongly attract the eye. ” The view,” says the Artist, “when we emerged from the rocky hills, was one not to be forgotten. The Valley of the Jordan lay stretched beneath our feet, in all the beauty of an Eastern evening. The Dead Sea, the silvery line of the rapid Jordan just visible, the gay colours of the pilgrim encampment glittering in the last rays of the setting sun, were fitter for the poet than the painter.”"

The waves they plash on the lonely strand,
The moon gives out her beams;
A fair knight rests on the silvery sand,
Begirt with happy dreams.
The beautiful Fairies, fairy-bedight.
Rise out of the great sea’s deeps;
They softly draw near to the youthful knight,
And they think that he certainly sleeps.
Then one with curious fingers feels
The feathers that deck his bonnet;
Another close to his shoulder-knot steals,
And plays with the chain upon it.
A third one laughs, and with cunning hand
Unsheaths the sword from its keeper;
And, leaning against the glittering brand,
She watches, well-pleased, the sleeper.
A fourth, she flutters about and above.
And sighs from her little bosom:
“Ah me! that I were thy true, true love,
Thou beautiful human blossom!”"

In April 1883, despite talks on the English side to abandon the project, work was apparently still under way. It finally stopped around July of the same year, mostly due to the British military establishment fearing the tunnel would put the island under constant threat of invasion.

Curmer’s Paul et Virginie is widely regarded as a highlight of the illustrated book production in the French Romantic era. First issued as a series of thirty installments, starting in 1836, it was released in 1838 as a single volume, sold for 45 francs[1].
Although embellished with approximately five hundred illustrations drawn by renowned, or soon-to-be renowned artists and carefully crafted in every way, its initial success started to wane after the first year. Out of the original 10,000 print run, 4,000 copies were left unsold by 1845, the year Curmer went bankrupt, and it wouldn’t sell out until 1848. By then, the expenses incurred amounted to 233,000 fr. and the profit to 82,000 fr.
In 1849, Léon Curmer looked back, not without some complacency, on his work on this epochal book and penned an extended note on the end papers of his freshly bound personal copy. Below is an excerpt from this note:
Here you are at last, my dear book, dressed up according to my wishes. I’ve been dreaming for ten years that this glory would be granted to you, and after ten years of hardship and work, of joy too, I have reached my goal. […]
Thanks to you, my dear book, I studied typography and was fortunate enough to somewhat improve on it, when one could have thought it had reached the limits of perfection. I lead a new way for papermaking. I made a revolution in working with printing inks, wood engraving had never before gone as far as it has with this book[2]…

Johannot invested 20,000 francs in this edition of Paul et Virginie, which covered about one tenth of the overall expenses. He was at the time far more famous than Français and this probably explains why his portrait has been placed closer to the wreathed allegory."

Innisfallen Island is described as follows by the authors:
In truth, this little island is very beautiful, resting as it does with so much ease and grace upon the surface of the lake; indented with the most fairy-like bays; elevated into rocky, though not rude magnificence at one side, while the opposite shore shelves to the water’s edge, and runs out into shallows. It is a miniature of a beautiful country—lawns, and dells, and thickets, and vistas, with the most lovely views of the lake and the mainland, that assume new aspects from every point of view."

At length we arrive at the Torc Waterfall—the most famous, and beyond comparison the most grand and beautiful of all the cascades about the Lakes. The path that leads to it is entered through a gate (close to which is a small lodge) and over a bridge which crosses the stream that runs into the lake.
The cascade is a chasm beween the mountains of Torc and Maugerton: the fall is between sixty and seventy feet. The path that leads to it by the side of the rushing and brawling current, which conducts it to the lake, has been judiciously curved, so as to conceal a full view of the fall until the visitor is immediately under it; but the opposite hill has been beautifully planted—Art having been summoned to the aid of Nature—and the tall young trees are blended with the evergreen arbutus, the holly, and a vast variety of shrubs. As we advance, the rush of waters gradually breaks upon the ear, and at a sudden turning the cataract is beheld in all its glory. And most glorious, in truth, it is, seen under any circumstances—even in the most arid season it is beautiful—the white foam breaking over huge rocks, casting the spray to inconceivable distances; rushing and brawling along its course into the valley; scattering its influences among the long green ferns, and giving such prodigious vigour to the wild vegetation it nourishes, that giant weeds thicken into underwood along its banks, and here and there meet and join across the stream."

As you approach the Gap, you will be arrested by some of the thousand and one women, boys, and girls, who will gather like a rolling snow-ball as you proceed. They will try to tempt you with goat’s-milk and “mountain dew;” but some of them will offer you stockings of their own knitting; in all ways they will try to wile the visitor out of halfpence—with a good supply of which he should therefore be provided."

Ross Island is described as follows by the authors:
 Ross is more properly a peninsula than an island, being separated from the main land only by a narrow cut through a morass, which it is more than probable was a work of art, with a view to strengthen the fortifications of the castle. The island, for so it must now be termed, is the largest island of the lake. It contains about eighty plantation acres, richly and luxuriantly cultivated; a portion of it is converted into a graceful and carefully kept flower-garden, where seats are placed so as to command the more striking and picturesque views; and in every part, Nature has been so judiciously trained and guided, that the whole scene is one of surpassing beauty.

And now let him look leisurely around him. He is in the midst of mountains—bleak and barren, but mighty in their magnificence. […] Their dark shadows arc thrown upon the water, so as to give it a character of gloom, in perfect keeping with the loneliness of the scene. One feels as if the sound of a human voice would disturb its solitude: and wishes the oars that row him over the Lake were muffled."

Several reprints of these recreated plates followed, up to the 1920s/30s. The book presented here is a copy of one of these late reprints*.
Les amours de Mr. Vieux Bois was first published in Geneva in 1837 and is known in English as The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck. (page saved to the Internet Archive)
For his graphic literature, Rodolphe Töpffer used a particular lithographic process known as autography, which consisted of transferring drawings made on special paper to lithographic stone. This method was cheaper and quicker than wood engraving while achieving equally good results, and it allowed for the lettering to retain the spontaneous appearance of handwriting.

The neck of the culprit passes through a hole in the centre, and his hands through smaller apertures on each side. Sometimes he is indulged with the freedom of one hand, which he employs in relieving the weight of the cangue from his galled shoulders.
Over the screw which secures the sections enclosing the offender’s neck, a paper is generally pasted, to which is affixed the seal or chop of the committing mandarin; and over another part of the log, a placard setting forth the crime which is visited by this degradation.
The weight of these moveable pillories is from sixty to two hundred pounds avoirdupois[1], and the time of endurance is proportioned, according to the judgment of the magistrate, to the magnitude of the offence. A criminal has been known to endure a heavy cangue for half a year, passing his nights in the dungeons of Ting-hai[2], and, when day appeared, led by a chain to the most frequented of the city-gates. The keeper, armed with a thick bamboo, or large thong-whip, conducts him to some position where he may recline against a wall, and ease his shoulders of their ponderous load. If both the culprit’s hands be confined, he cannot raise food or drink to his mouth, in which case the attendant feeds him with the wretched jail-allowance; or some compassionate occupants of the adjoining houses, near to which he happens to be placed for the day, supply him with refreshments."

The lawns that extend, or rather rise, from the bank of the silvery Pei-ho to the pleasure-grounds of the villa, constitute a spacious demesne, intersected by artificial rivulets, adorned with artificial lakes, and embellished with bridges more numerous than necessary, and constructed for luxury rather than convenience.

This plate is commented as follows by the author:
Opposite to the Sala de dos Hermanas, is the Sala de los Abencerrages, or Hall of the Abencerrages, so called from the massacre of that illustrious tribe […].
The Hall of the Abencerrages appears to have been a central saloon communicating with the other apartments of the palace. Every possible variety of combinations, which can be devised by ingenuity or patience, is employed to decorate the walls and ceiling; and is executed in the most exquisite manner that can be conceived. The lines regularly cross each other in a thousand forms; and, after manifold windings, return to the spot whence they first begin. […] These uncommon designs appear again in different parts, and were probably formed by pouring prepared gypsum into moulds, and, after applying it to the walls, by painting it with gold, azure, and purple. The ceiling itself is equally extraordinary, and worthy of admiration: it presents a series of grottos, from which depend stalactites, painted of various colours.

Therefore, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to believe that the actual date of publication of the edition presented here might have been 1816 and not 1813.

On looking from the royal villa or pleasure-house of Al Generalife, which is delineated in the latter part of this work, the spectator beholds the side of the palace of Alhamrā, that commands the quarter of the city, called the Albayzin. The massive towers are connected by solid walls, constructed upon the system of fortifications which generally prevailed in the middle ages. These walls and towers follow all the turnings and windings of the mountain ; and, previously to the invention of gunpowder and artillery, this fortress must have been almost impregnable. The situation of this edifice is the most delightful and commanding, that can well be conceived. Wherever the spectator may turn his eyes, it is impossible for him not to be struck with admiration at the picturesque
beauty and fertility of the surrounding country. On the north and west, as far as the eye can reach, a lovely plain presents itself, which is covered with an immense number of trees laden with fruits or blossoms, while on the south it is bounded by mountains; whose lofty summits are crowned with perpetual snows, whence issue the springs and streams that diffuse both health and coolness through the city of Granada.

This plate exhibits to considerable advantage the massive architecture of the Alhamrā: the principal approach to it is through the narrow Cale de los Gomeles, or Street of Gomeles, so called from the ancient and powerful Moorish family of that name. From this street, which has retained its original form, after passing through a gate into the outward inclosure of the Alhamrā, the road ascends by a winding path through a wood of lofty elms, intermixed with other handsome trees. Wild neglected walks intersect the ascent in various directions; and streams of water, gushing on every side from the moss-covered rocks, frequently spread over the whole road. Near the summit of the hill, is a large and formerly handsome fountain erected by the Emperor Charles V. It is now in a state of very considerable decay, and, like the rest of this magnificent edifice, exhibits a monument of departed splendour. All is verdant, and most beautifully picturesque on this delicious spot.

The two beneath are from the southern portico of St. Mark’s; the shafts having been of different lengths, and neither, in all probability, originally intended for their present place, they have double abaci, of which the uppermost is the cornice running round the whole facade.

A Norse legend
The great King Warwolf waxing old,
And feeling that death was nigh at hand,
Resolved to die as a hero should—
Not pent in a bed, and then hid in the sand;
So he clad him brave in his golden mail,
And took his axe and his massiest shield,
And his spear, and his bow, and his two-edged sword—
That no one else but himself could wield.
And he bade them drag his galley forth,
And load it with trunks of the driest pine,
And store it with oak-butts knotty and ringed,
And pile it with fir-cones line on line.
So they set the gold-cloth sails all fair,
And they tied the well-worn helm due north,
And they bore him down on their brazen shields
To the barque that was destined to bear him forth.
Sitting erect on his fir-tree throne,
In his royal robe and glittering crown,
As the fateful galley bore away
Slowly out of sight of the town,
Singing to Odin hymns of praise,
Cheerily, though with a failing breath,
He went in splendour and bold of heart,
In a kingly way to meet King Death.
They watched till they saw the ship go down
Below the long grey line of sea;
And then there arose a great red glare,
That seemed to crimson fitfully
The whole broad heaven, and melt the waves
Into one caldron of blood-red light,
And soon all suddenly there fell
A pitchy gloom, and then came NIGHT."

At the height of sixty feet is a solid projecting platform, formerly reached by a steep flight of steps, now thrown down. On this platform stands the gateway represented in the drawing. It measures twenty-two feet in front, and is twenty-two feet high, and was most elaborately adorned with sculptured stone-work. The ornaments are of similar design to those of the Casa del Gobernador, but executed perhaps with a greater degree of delicacy. The remains of two statues are seen, and most likely the niche in the centre was for the reception of a larger one. The doorway is five feet five inches wide, and ten feet high with lintels of sapote wood still in their places. The interior is divided into two apartments,—the outer, fifteen feet long, by seven feet wide, and nineteen feet high; and the inner one, twelve feet long, four feet wide, and eleven feet high. Both are entirely destitute of ornament, and it is not easy to conjecture to what end they served, as they are small, and have no apparent connection with the rest ot the building."

Michel-Vincent (sometimes called Charles) Brandoin was a Swiss artist born in Vevey in 1733 and who died in Morges in 1807. He was a neoclassic painter of landscapes and architecture and the occasional caricature. He worked in England between 1768 and 1772 and this may be the reason why the style of this satirical work seems to owe something to William Hogarth.
An engraving from the painting was made by Caldwell and published in London in 1771. It appears to be this engraving that was used as a reference by the workshop of Andrew, Best & Leloir.

His grandfather, Vieri di Cambio de Medici, had created a banker’s company which, by 1380, had branches in Rome, Genoa, Bruges and Venice. In the hands of Cosimo, this business acquired an even stronger European position, and he would soon lend money to the Pope and to the kings of France and England.
This wealth allowed him to become the real ruler of Florence, as well as a lavish patron of art and literature. Among the artists he supported were Brunelleschi, Fra Filippo Lippi, Gozzoli, and Donatello. By founding a new Platonic Academy in Florence, he played a major part in the influence neoplatonism was to exert on Italian Renaissance, particularly through the works of Marsilio Ficino.

An original linkage converted the vertical movement of the piston into circular motion for which there were more industrial applications.
A flyball governor was used to regulate the amount of steam allowed in the engine. This system, combined with a heavy flywheel, made it possible to control the rotation speed.
A new distribution system, which applied steam to both sides of the piston, increased the power of the engine as well as the steadiness of movement.
Watt’s first steam engine dates back to 1765. It is estimated that by 1800, he and his partner, Matthew Boulton, had built 500.

It was a steam-powered locomotive, particularly well suited for the transport of passengers because of its stability and its speed: the author refers to it as the “racehorse of railways”.
A Crampton locomotive could haul 12 to 16 carriages, weighing up to 100 to 130 tons at a speed of 37 mph (60 km/h). When running on its own, it could reach 75 mph (120 km/h).

The continuous rotary movement allows for greater speed than the alternating movements of a flatbed press.
In 1812, Friedrich König designed a printing press equipped with a pressure cylinder, which allowed to ink and print at the same time as well as to combine the press with a steam engine. In 1847, Richard Hoe patented a printing press with a rotary movement, but Hoe’s machine didn’t use continuous rolls of paper. Those came only with the later improvements brought by William A. Bullock, in 1865.
The first Marinoni rotary press was built in 1866 and could print pages on both sides. In 1872, a press was introduced which used continuous rolls of paper and, in 1884, it mechanically folded the printed pages.

Its use spread quickly during the eighteenth century with showmen traveling around like peddlers, and with the advent of new horror shows known as phantasmagorias.

The main technical challenge to make these vehicles useful was to prevent their weight from causing deep grooves or ruts in their tracks.
In 1867, Robert William Thomson patented solid India-rubber tires for the road steamers manufactured in his Leith workshop. Fitted with this equipment, a vehicle like the one shown above could be driven across a meadow without the wheels sinking too deeply into the ground. On a flat road, it could tow 30 tons at a speed of 2.5 to 6 mph (4 to 10 km/h); it could reach 16 to 18 horsepower.
In England, some of these steamers were used to carry coal from mines to nearby factories. They were also used on an omnibus line in Edinburgh, and various tests were conducted by the postal administration in the province of Punjab in India.

Natural layering occurs when a branch comes in contact with the ground and spontaneously grows roots. Horticulturists have taken advantage of this phenomenon to propagate desirable species.
Mound (or stool) layering is suitable for heavy-stemmed trees with tight branches. In the spring, the stems of a young tree are cut about 15 cm (6 inches) above the trunk, which will result in the sprouting of plenty of new buds. The following spring, soil is mounded over the young shoots growing from the buds in order for roots to develop. This technique is known to be successful with apple rootstocks, quince, daphne, magnolia, and cotoneaster.

The cork oak (Quercus suber) is an evergreen tree which can live 150 to 250 years. It reaches maturity and begins being harvested for cork after 25 years: an incision is first made into the bark with a sharp knife, then the cork is gently lifted from the tree in sections approximately three feet high. It remains stacked in the forest for further maturation for three to six months.
To prevent injuring or weakening the tree, only 50% of the bark, at most, is removed at a time and the same tree is harvested only once every nine years (although this period can sometimes be shortened to six years). Harvesting cork is still a hand process and hasn’t changed much since cork was first used.

In 1801, under the Concordat, the bishopric of Mâcon was abolished and merged with that of Autun.

On March 31, 1871, three days after the election of the Commune by the Parisians, the red flag was flown on the building.

Words come hissing from her lips and hit their target with a short, dry sound.

The flowers form greenish-yellow umbels and give rise to small black berries, poisonous to humans. As a medicinal plant, ivy used to be taken for its purgative properties, and extracts still enter into the composition of cough syrups and cough drops.

3483,Unknown,Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus).,https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/gharial/,"The gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) is a reptile in the family Gavialidae. It is one of the largest living crocodilians, second only to the Saltwater Crocodile, with some males growing to more than 20 feet (6 meters) long. Its long and narrow snout, with a bulbous growth at the end, makes it easy to distinguish from crocodiles and alligators.
Gharials feed on fish and spend most of their time in deep and fast-moving rivers of India and nearby countries. They are particularly agile and quick in water, but their movements on land are limited, as their morphology doesn’t allow them to lift their belly from the ground.
They are harmless to humans and threatened by extinction with a population in the wild estimated around 1,500.

The Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is a tree squirrel which can be found throughout the forests of Europe and northern Asia. However, great changes in population densities have been observed over the last century and it has, for instance, almost disappeared from Britain and other parts of Europe.
It is a diurnal arboreal rodent that feeds on coniferous seeds, nuts, and even mushrooms such as deer truffles, and eggs. It has a long and fluffy furry tail, and its coat color may vary a lot, ranging from red to black, including various shades of brown. Red squirrels can live up to 6 or 7 years in the wild, although the average lifespan is probably between 2 and 4 years. They are constantly on the alert, watching out for predators, which include more particularly pine martens and birds of prey.

Like the other cormorants, its feathers are not fully waterproofed, which makes it heavier in the water and allows it to dive quicker and deeper: the great cormorant can stay under water for 20 to 30 seconds without any problem and it can dive to 32.80 ft (10 m) and more to find its food. It is also one of the few birds to be able to move its eyes.
In China, a traditional fishing technique involves sending cormorants out to fish with a ring fitted tight enough around their neck, so they can’t swallow their prey. When the bird comes back to the boat, the fisherman only has to make it open its mouth to retrieve the fish.

The siege lasted until the French capitulation, which lead to a cease-fire agreement on January 26, 1871, and to the Treaty of Frankfurt later that same year.
During these four months, it was essential for the Parisians to communicate with the rest of the country as the Government of National Defense had withdrawn to Bordeaux. All available means were put to use and balloons were probably the most spectacular of them.
The first balloon to leave Paris, the Neptune, lifted off from Montmartre on September 23, 1870. More than sixty balloons flew across the sky of Paris during this period, including the one used by Léon Gambetta, at the time Minister of the Interior, on October 7.
In addition to passengers, balloons transported mail as well as carrier pigeons. The pilots were often recruited in the navy, and these flights were particularly risky: two balloons were lost at sea, another fell in the middle of enemy lines, a fourth one landed in Norway…
Among the balloon manufacturers, we must mention Nadar, the famous pioneer of aerial photographs, and the Godard Company. The Godard workshop was first established in Gare d’Orleans, as shown in this picture, and moved to Gare du Nord after Gare d’Orleans was damaged by the Prussians. A total of 34 balloons were built in the Godard workshops.

It becomes peculiarly valuable in the estimation of the architectural antiquary, from shewing the style and character of the triforium, the clerestory, with its thick wall pierced with a corridor, or passage, its vaulted and ribbed roof, and its aisles, all of which were rebuilt, in a very different, and I must add a very indifferent, style from the designs of the late Mr. James Wyatt, who has unfortunately left other specimens of ill applied and ill designed works in the Cathedrals of Salisbury, Lichfield, and Durham.

François Ringuette, known as Rouge d’Auneau (a nickname he probably owed to the color of his hair) was for some time one of the leaders of the gang, a time when he also married the La Belle Victoire. His influence later declined, when supporters of brute force took the advantage over those who preferred to use cunning and trickery to seize farms. He could be seen around 1795 fitting this description:
He was a young man, almost a child, lean and short, with a long and pale face, and his right eye bloodshot and teary. His hair, reddish and dull, without any glint, was tied into a tail. He wore a carmagnole jacket with black and yellow stripes, suede pants, mottled socks and steel-buckled shoes. The whole costume showed claims to elegance, thwarted by the fortunes of a vagrant and villainous life[1].
He seems to have been known for his cruelty and was sentenced to death and executed on October 4, 1800, in Chartres, along with 23 other members of the gang.
Old Élouis is introduced to us as follows:
Old Élouis was tradition alive. This plump little old man, white-haired, with a venerable beard, fresh little round cheeks, small gray-blue eyes full of fire, attested to a strong, excellent health. And yet he had been around for over eighty years. He had known several generations of thieves, and he could have told the name of every famous bandit who had worked between Chartres and Etampes since Louis XIV. With his spotless blue jacket, his crude clogs and his canvas trousers, old Élouis had quite the look of a workshop patriarch[2].
He is credited with suggesting the idea of burning the victims’ feet to make them tell where their money was hidden. He died before the trial of the gang.
The caption reads in the original French: Le père Élouis et le Rouge d’Auneau."

In this plate, the altar, or sacrificial stone, forms the principal object in the foreground. It is three feet six inches high, above the ground, and measures seven feet from angle to angle. It is sculpted into four hideous heads of colossal size, having enormous fangs, and distended eyes, adding, no doubt, the finishing horror to the bloody sacrifices which there can be little doubt were enacted on it. Certain channels (now nearly obliterated) exist on its upper surface, to carry off the blood of the human victim; and to render the operation of cutting open the breast, and tearing out the heart more easy, the upper surface of the stone is convex, agreeing with the account of the early Spanish discoverers. It was painted red, a fitting colour for so sanguinary a ritual. The idol, to whom the sacrifice was offered, stands at a distance of twelve feet from the sacrificial stone. It is eleven feet nine inches high, and three feet square, cut out of a single block of stone, and has elaborate carvings on the back and sides. It is conjectured to be the portrait of some deified hero or chieftain, from certain traces of individuality in the features. There are remains of a beard and moustache, and the whole figure is enveloped and overladen with a complicated dress and head ornament. It stands at the foot of a pyramidal terrace, or wall, which probably supported a sacred edifice."

It was a very imposing and ambitious project at the time and much more so than any other commemorative column that had been raised to that date.

This plate is commented as follows by the author:
Nothing can be more striking than the view presented to the spectator, on his first entrance into this magnificent temple; which has, not inaptly, been compared to a forest of columns disposed in the form of a quincunx. […]
The columns at present are about eight hundred and fifty in number; and are formed of granite, porphyry, jasper, and other marbles, exhibiting an assemblage of various and brilliant colours. The whole, taken together, presents a scene so truly unique, that the visitor is at a loss, whether to admire most their number, or their richness: but, from the variety of styles prevailing in the different parts of which these columns are composed, it is evident that they originally belonged to different nations and ages. Many of them were taken from Roman edifices; which being of various lengths, the Arabian architect supplied the want of a sufficient quantity of capitals and bases, by imitating those which were before his eyes. […]
On a slight inspection of Plate V. it may perhaps strike the observer, that the general effect would have been improved, and the perspective heightened, by the introduction of a little more light from above: but, had such a correction been made, our engraving would not have been a faithful representation of the solemn and majestic interior of the Mosque at Cordova. A “dim, religious light” is admitted into it, by the doors on the sides, and from several small cupolas above; which falls upon some parts of this immense edifice, while others are left in awful darkness. Individuals, walking through this forest of columns may, by an ardent imagination, not unaptly be compared to wandering spirits—their persons may readily be distinguished, but their footsteps cannot be heard.
The title page of this book mentions 1813 as the date of publication and it is the one we chose to follow, as being officially provided by the publisher. It should be noted, however, that every plate in the book comes with the following inscription: London. Published by Cadell & Davies. June 1st. 1815.
In addition, the page facing the first illustration mentions the “just published” History of the Mahometan Empire in Spain by Thomas Hartwell Horne, a book which was first published in 1816. Therefore, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to believe that the actual date of publication of the edition presented here might have been 1816 and not 1813.

The bridge over Ludgate Hill was demolished in 1990.
The following is an excerpt of the article facing the illustration, published in the Illustrated London News on November 14, 1863:
The engraving of this structure which we give on the preceding page accurately represents the bridge intended to be forthwith erected by the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company across Ludgate-Hill and the position in which it will be placed. The design is identical with that exhibited by the company in 1860 before the Parliamentary Committees of both Houses.
At the point where this bridge will cross Ludgate-Hill the street itself is only 42 ft. wide; but, as the City Corporation intend at some future time to enlarge the thoroughfare, the span is to be made 18 ft. wider than the street, and will extend, therefore, to 60 ft. It will be composed of five girders of wrought iron, which will be screened from sight by ornamental ironwork, and their straight, hard lines will be broken up by brackets of cast iron and by medallions. The latter are to be eight in number, and made of bronze, bearing alternately the city of London arms and those of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company. The City arms will be the largest and most prominent, and will be placed immediately beneath the four handsome gas-lamps by which the bridge will be lighted. The parapets will be of cast iron. The abutments, formed of dressed Portland stone, will contain staircases leading from the pavement beneath, by means of which persons may proceed to the railway station—to be situated almost directly overhead—or they may cross the bridge by one of the two footways placed at its side and communicating with the companion staircase in the opposite abutment, descend, and so avoid all danger and inconvenience in crossing a road usually thronged by horses and vehicles of all descriptions. The bridge will carry four lines of rail—two of mixed and two of narrow gauge, and it will be raised 18 ft. above the level of the street.
[…]
In regard to the various plans proposed to obviate the necessity of having a railway bridge across Ludgate-Hill, little need now be said. The chief difficulty in the way of tunnelling was the short distance from the bank of the Thames to the junction which this line must make with the Metropolitan line, and which would necessitate a very steep gradient. But this was not all. Had the line been carried under Ludgate-Hill it would have had to make a slight detour, for the purpose of easing the ascent, and the cost of constructing it would have been enormously increased. One of the most feasible of the suggestions made in regard to a change of course and to the construction of a tunnel involved the destruction of Apothecaries’ Hall, the churchyard adjoining it, the Times printing-offices, and serious interference with the foundations of St. Martin’s Church, Ludgate-Hill, the Old Bailey Sessions House, and Newgate Prison.
The railway authorities have done much in this matter towards meeting the wishes of the public, without actually imperilling the success of their own undertaking. They are about to erect a bridge which will be wide enough to admit of improvements being made in the thoroughfare beneath—one that will contrast very forcibly with the less ornamental, yet still, perhaps, useful, girder-bridge now in course of erection near London Bridge.
The designs for the Ludgate-Hill Railway Bridge were furnished by Messrs. Joseph Cubitt and F. T. Turner, joint engineers to the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company; the architectural features being designed by Mr. John Taylor, jun., architect. The bridge, which will be commenced immediately, will, it is stated, be completed in the course of next spring.

Izamal, at the height of its prosperity, must have been one of the most important of the Indian cities of Yucatan. There is abundant testimony to prove that it was inhabited at the time of the Spanish conquest. There are still remaining several mounds, one of which is the largest in Yucatan, but so dilapitated and disfigured, as to defy accurate measurement: it may be about seven hundred feet long and sixty high. It is said to contain interior chambers and colossal statues; but no entrance at present exists to these subterranean apartments. The great church and convent of the Franciscan monks stands on the upper platform of one of these ancient teocalli, and the open area fronting the church is probably not less than two hundred feet square, surrounded on three sides by an open colonnade, forming a noble promenade, overlooking the modern city of Izamal and the surrounding country to a great distance. On the side of a mound about two hundred feet long, and which formerly had stone and stucco ornaments from one end to the other, is the Colossal Head—perhaps of some deity—represented in the plate: it is seven feet eight inches in height, and seven feet in width. A stone, one foot six inches long, protrudes from the chin, intended perhaps for burning copal on."

Bolonchen derives its name from two Maya words,—Bolon, which signifies “nine,” and Chen, “wells;” and it means “the nine wells.”
[…] The custody and supply of these wells form a principal part of the business of the village authorities, but with all their care the supply of water lasts but seven or eight months in the year. At the period of our visit the time was approaching when the wells would fail, and the inhabitants be driven to an extraordinary cavern, at half a league’s distance from the village.
There was one grand difficulty in the way of our visiting the cavern, or well. Since the commencement of the rainy season it had not been used; and every year, before having recourse to it, there was a work of several days to be done in repairing the ladders.
Setting out, however, from the village of Bolonchen, by the Campeachy road, we turned off by a well beaten path, following which we fell into a winding lane, and, descending gradually, reached the foot of a rude, lofty, and abrupt opening, under a bold ledge of overhanging rock, seeming a magnificent entrance to a great temple for the worship of the God of nature.
[…] The cave was damp, and the rock and the ladder were wet and slippery. It was evident that the labour of exploring this cave was to be greatly increased by the state of the ladders, and there might be some danger attending it; but, even after all we had seen of caves, there was something so wild and grand in this that we could not bring ourselves to give up the attempt. Fortunately, the Cura had taken care to provide us with a rope, and fastening one end round a large stone, an Indian carried the other down to the foot of the ladder. We followed one at a time; holding the rope with one hand, and with the other grasping the side of the ladder : it was impossible to carry a torch, and we were obliged to feel our way in the dark, or with only such light as could reach us from the torches above and below. At the foot of this ladder was a large cavernous chamber, with irregular passages branching off in different directions to seven deposites or sources of water, from which the village of Bolonchen is supplied.

The author of the corresponding entry offers the following additional information:
The invention of the Corliss engine marks an era in steam engine construction, and the history of its introduction bears a striking analogy to that of the pumping engine invented by Watt. Like Watt, Mr. Corliss was contented to displace the older forms of engines by his more perfect device, and take in payment the value of a portion of the coal saved; and like Watt, he soon found that proprietors of mills were unwilling to render him true accounts of the saving effected. Now that the patent has expired, the Corliss engine, or some modification, has been largely adopted as the standard design by engine-builders in this country; and it has displaced almost all other styles abroad."

With the exceptions of Oscar Wilde and Sir Augustus Harris, it doesn’t seem these identities have been established beyond any doubt.
On the occasion of the publication of Plays, the Daily Chronicle printed a review criticizing Beardsley’s frontispiece for portraying Two well-known faces of the day. Bearsley replied with the following letter, which was published in the next issue:  
Sir, — In your review of Mr. Davidson’s plays, I find myself convicted of an error of taste, for having introduced portraits into my frontispiece to that book. I cannot help feeling that your reviewer is unduly severe. One of the gentlemen who forms part of my decoration is surely beautiful enough to stand the test even of portraiture, the other owes me half a crown.
I am, yours truly,
Aubrey Beardsley.
114 Cambridge Street, S.W.
March 1, 1894.
The reference to the gentleman who “owes me half a crown” was probably aimed at Sir Augustus Harris, the administrator of the Covent Garden, who was in the unfortunate habit of selling more tickets than the theater could accommodate people. The story has it that on one occasion, Beardsley came to find his seat already taken."

Swamp white oak.",https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/quercus-bicolor/,"Stipple engraving showing leaves, acorn, and tip of a branch of the swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor), a tree in the family Fagaceae native to North America. This tree is described as follows by the author:
The swamp white oak is a beautiful tree, more than 70 feet (21 m) in height, of which the vegetation is vigorous and the foliage luxuriant. The leaves are 6 or 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) long and 4 inches (10 cm) broad, smooth and of a dark green above, downy and lighter coloured beneath; they are entire towards the base, which is cuneiform, but are widened and coarsely toothed for two thirds of their length towards the summit. The tree is distinguished, when young, by the form of its base and by the down upon its leaves, which is more sensible to the touch than on any analogous species. At a riper age the lower side of the leaf is of a silvery white, which is strikingly contrasted with the bright green of the upper surface; hence the specific name of discolor Was given it by Dr. Muhlemberg.
The acorns are sweet, but seldom abundant; they are rather large, of a brown complexion, and contained in a spreading cup edged with short slender filaments, more downy within than those of any other oak, and supported by peduncles 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm) in length. The trunk is clad in a scaly greyish white bark. The wood is strong, elastic, and heavier than that of the white oak.

Each one of them has a gift for Death: one offers him a hat adorned with a cock feather, and a glimpse of himself in a mirror, another gives a sword, the others a pair of scales, a scythe, a horse. Cunning and Falsehood point toward Justice they have defeated and bound, and from whom they have taken the sword and the scales.
The title reads in the original German: Der Tod entsteigt dem Grab. 
Alfred Rethel’s Dance of Death is a series of six woodcuts engraved under the supervision of Hugo Bürkner and usually known as Yet Another Dance of Death (Auch ein Totentanz), or sometimes A Dance of Death from the Year 1848 (Ein Todtentanz aus dem Jahre 1848). A reaction to the popular uprisings and democratic revolutions which spread across Europe at the time, it was first published in 1849 to great acclaim, accompanied by verses by Robert Reinick which give insights into the scenes. This combination of words and pictures is usually considered a staunch counterrevolutionary and reactionary manifesto,[1] highligting the destructive folly of rebellion and revolutions, and the dangers of pursuing such pipedreams as liberty, fraternity, and republican systems. Some attempts have been made, however, to nuance this understanding of Rethel’s opinions."

The present bird is one of the smallest of the Terns, and, as far as is known, in habits and general mode of life does not differ from the other members of the family. 
This species frequents the colder latitudes of the southern hemisphere, but occasionally visits the coasts of New Zealand and Tasmania, and some fine specimens were procured by Gould near Maria Island, off the coast of the latter island. […] Except for its much smaller size and darker hue of plumage, there is a strong resemblance between this species and one inhabiting the Falkland Islands, in the South Atlantic.
The species is gregarious at all seasons of the year, and about the low sandy islands of the Abrolhos shoals and the the islands of the Dampier and Buccaneer Archipelagos—all of which are situated in the warm seas of the West Australian coast—large flocks of these graceful sea rangers are seen continually passing to and fro, especially in the early morning and towards the close of the day; during the heat of the day, and after the birds have finished the morning’s fishing about the coral reefs and sandbanks, they retire to the shore and seek the shelter of the stunted herbage."

And vainly parley with thine ashes dumb:
Since she who now bestows and now denies

The barren flowers of the black birch are disposed in flexible aments about four inches long. The fertile aments, which are commonly situated at the extremity of the young branches, are ten or twelve lines long and five or six lines in diameter, straight, cylindrical, and nearly sessile at the season of the maturity of the seed, which is about the first of November.
The bark, upon the trunk of trees less than eight inches in diameter, is smooth, grayish, and perfectly similar in its color and organization to that of the cherry tree. On old trees, the epidermis detaches itself transversely, at intervals, in hard ligneous plates, six or eight inches (fifteen or twenty centimeters) broad.

This species is common on the coasts of tropical Australia and in Torres Straits it is abundant.

The Australian pelican is an aquatic bird in the family Pelecanidae. Its fishing habits are described as follows by the author:
The food consists of fish, and the method pursued by a large flock of these birds working together to obtain their food is an amazing and a most instructive sight. Spreading out so as to enclose the space of water into the shallow end of which it is desired to drive the fish, they start, apparently on the giving of a signal, beating the water into foam with their wings. Making thus a resounding roar, they gradually close in towards the shoal water, driving their prey before them. When they have thus closed their victims into a narrow space, and apparently after another signal has been given to change tactics, the beating is discontinued and a most exciting scramble ensues for the fish which have been hemmed in."

As regards the plate by Le Roy, which I scaled down to the requested dimensions, I had a photograph taken on location to help me read the main structure of that graceful monument. My etching was done with a lot of conscientiousness, but is too fussy and still too harsh in its execution. I have since also noticed that I could easily have made it more complete by better modeling certain parts and putting in some more work.

The live oak is commonly 40 or 45 feet (12 or 14 m) in height, and from 1 to 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 m) in diameter; but it is sometimes much larger: Mr. S., president of the Agricultural Society of Charleston, assured me that he had felled a trunk, hollowed by age, which was 24 feet (7 m) in circumference. Like most other trees, it has, when insulated, a wide and tufted summit. Its trunk is sometimes undivided for 18 or 20 feet (5.5 or 6 m), but often ramifies at half this height, and at a distance it has the appearance of an old apple tree or pear tree. The leaves are oval, coriaceous, of a dark green above and whitish beneath: they persist during several years, and are partially renewed every spring. On trees reared upon plantations, or growing in cool soils, they are one half larger, and are often denticulated: upon stocks of two or three years they are commonly very distinctly toothed.

The glacier, however, was quite clear. I sketched it from the small hamlet of Suphellen, as seen in Plate VII. From hence, as from the sea, the glacier appears as if in complete continuity with the great snow-field above. It was not until (as is my custom) I had mounted some way over the ice itself, that I discovered, to my surprise, that a very lofty cliff of rock entirely separates the upper from the lower glacier, the latter being in fact what is termed by the later Swiss writers a glacier remanié,[2] formed altogether of icy fragments precipitated by avalanches from the steep and pinnacled glacier above.

4197,"Forbes, James David",Glacier of Bondhuus.,https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/illustrations/bondhusbreen/,"View of the Bondhusbreen, a glacier located in Hordaland county, Norway. It is described as follows by the author:
Our path to the Bondhuus Brae[1] (or glacier) lay right up a lateral valley, at whose opening the little village is placed, and from which a foaming torrent of no small size rushes to the sea. We began at once to ascend a very steep mound of debris, with a level top, which closes the valley. […] The views are very striking and alpine; the glacier is always the principal object, even from the sea. It descends at first gradually from the snow-fields of the Folgefond[2] between two precipitous rocks, and falls steeply into the valley, with a slope comparable to that of the Glacier des Bossons descending from Mont Blanc."
